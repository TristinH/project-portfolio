The goal of this project was to design a website to display various projects that I will complete
as I study with Udacity. A design mock-up was given to emulate through css and html techniques. I used
Twitter's bootstrap framework for the majority of the styling and for the responsiveness of the webpage.
While I tried to follow the structure of the template given to us, I also tried to make it unique by
customizing the pictures, logo, and text to better suit my creative tastes. The result is a responsive
webpage that shows off some of the projects I am looking forward to completing.
